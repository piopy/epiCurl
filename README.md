# epiCurl
 
Library I wrote to start scraping websites, contains quick method to [gimmeproxy.com](https://gimmeproxy.com) and some CURL methods to scrape easier (::c::f::) protected websites.

It does a wombo-combo with [html-simple-DOM-parser](https://simplehtmldom.sourceforge.io/docs/1.9/index.html)
